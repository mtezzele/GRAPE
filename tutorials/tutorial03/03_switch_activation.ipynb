    "\n",
    "The input for the graph construction currently consists of text files reflecting the hierarchy of the plant elements and their features. In the text input files each line corresponds to a node/element description.\n",

    "In this way each line corresponds to an edge connecting a element to its parent element.\n",

    "Each line should contain the following info:\n",
    "- element id (**mark**)\n",

    "- id of the parent of the element (**father_mark**)\n",

In fact, if the input is properly formatted, with this simple digraph model it is possible to represent and integrate different interconnected plants in a unique graph without losing information about their peculiarities. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the graph, the nodes represent the system elements while the edges connecting the nodes harbor the logic relations (edge attributes) existing between the elements (*ORPHAN*, *SINGLE*, *AND*, and *OR*):\n",

    "- A **SINGLE** edge connects a node to its only one predecessor.\n",
    "- An **AND** edge indicates that the node/element has more than one predecessor. All the predecessors are necessary for the functioning of that element.\n",
    "- An **OR** edge indicates that the node/element has more than one predecessor. Just one of the node’s predecessors should be active to guarantee the functioning of the element. For this reason, correct input formatting is one of the most important steps of the analysis."

    "### Switch activation\n",
    "`SWITCH` nodes are a particular kind of `HUB` nodes. Their activation can stop the propagation of a fault in a graph, avoiding a very dangerous cascade effect. Differently from the `perturbation_resistant` nodes, which represent a passive resistance which does not need to be activated, these nodes are characterized by two possible values: `True` or `False`. The choice between the two values is made thanks to a genetic algorithm procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "A genetic algorithm generates a population of individuals with random genes, and makes them evolve mimicking Darwin’s theory of evolution:\n",
    "- *Selection*: the best individuals of the previous generation are chosen to breed the new one, according to their fitnesses\n",
    "- *Crossover*: combine the genetic information of two parents to create a new offspring\n",
    "- *Mutation*: individuals evolve by changing part of their genes\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterating this process for a certain number of times (generations), it is possible to optimize the original population.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to implement our genetic algorithm we used [DEAP (Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python)](https://github.com/deap/deap).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Switch state\n",
    "The first concept that we need, to describe how the genetic algorithm works, is the concept of *state*: a *state* for `GRAPE` is defined as a list of values for all the switches present in the graph. There can be many different combinations of values for the switches, each one identifying a different *state*. In the following figure you can see one of the possible realizations for S<sub>1, ..., 8</sub>:\n",

    "<img src=\"./input_files/switch_state.png\" alt=\"switch_state\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Switch fitness\n",
    "Every *state* of the switches is accompanied by a certain quantity, defined *fitness*, that gives us information on how much the configuration is genetically favourable. In GRAPE, we define the best *state* as the one that minimizes the fitness. Three main quantities constitute the fitness evaluation:\n",
    "- *number of actions*: this quantity expresses the number of flips (in terms of changes from `True` to `False` or vice-versa) that need to be made with respect to the initial condition for the switches, in order to obtain the concerned configuration\n",
    "- *total final service at USERs*: the sum of the total final service\n",
    "- *final graph size*: the total number of surviving nodes after the perturbation, for that given configuration of switches\n",
    "\n",
    "The final fitness is easily given by: $(# actions) - (total final service) - (final graph size)$."
